## Why do this?
I am reading a book called "Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI" by Anil Ananthaswamy and I came across the topic of the Monty Hall problem.
My first read through I did not really get what was being said, so I took a week and read over the same chapter again and I finally grasped the question.
Following the books explanation of why the math works how it does and Bayes Theorem I still did not accept that changing your choice was twice as likeley to
net a win. So I decided to make a program myself to test this, sure I couldve probably found one online but by making it myself I felt I could better grasp
why decisions could be better or worse when new information is given.

## What is the Monty Hall problem?
The Monty Hall Problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a game show setup:
- You're presented with 3 doors â€” behind one is a car, behind the other two, goats.
You pick a door.
- The host, who knows where the car is, opens another door to reveal a goat.
- You're then given a choice: stick with your original door or switch to the remaining unopened one.

  When you change your answer you have a 2/3 chance of winning.

Why does this go against most of our intuition?
